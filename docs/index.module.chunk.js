/**
 * AnimationBuilder is an injectable service that is available when the {\@link
 * BrowserAnimationsModule BrowserAnimationsModule} or {\@link NoopAnimationsModule
 * NoopAnimationsModule} modules are used within an application.
 *
 * The purpose if this service is to produce an animation sequence programmatically within an
 * angular component or directive.
 *
 * Programmatic animations are first built and then a player is created when the build animation is
 * attached to an element.
 *
 * ```ts
 * // remember to include the BrowserAnimationsModule module for this to work...
 * import {AnimationBuilder} from '\@angular/animations';
 *
 * class MyCmp {
 *   constructor(private _builder: AnimationBuilder) {}
 *
 *   makeAnimation(element: any) {
 *     // first build the animation
 *     const myAnimation = this._builder.build([
 *       style({ width: 0 }),
 *       animate(1000, style({ width: '100px' }))
 *     ]);
 *
 *     // then create a player from it
 *     const player = myAnimation.create(element);
 *
 *     player.play();
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * When an animation is built an instance of {\@link AnimationFactory AnimationFactory} will be
 * returned. Using that an {\@link AnimationPlayer AnimationPlayer} can be created which can then be
 * used to start the animation.

/**
 * `trigger` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's
 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the
 * {\@link Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better
 * understanding of how animations in Angular are used.
 *
 * `trigger` Creates an animation trigger which will a list of {\@link state state} and
 * {\@link transition transition} entries that will be evaluated when the expression
 * bound to the trigger changes.
 *
 * Triggers are registered within the component annotation data under the
 * {\@link Component#animations animations section}. An animation trigger can be placed on an element
 * within a template by referencing the name of the trigger followed by the expression value that
 * the
 * trigger is bound to (in the form of `[\@triggerName]="expression"`.
 *
 * Animation trigger bindings strigify values and then match the previous and current values against
 * any linked transitions. If a boolean value is provided into the trigger binding then it will both
 * be represented as `1` or `true` and `0` or `false` for a true and false boolean values
 * respectively.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * `trigger` will create an animation trigger reference based on the provided `name` value. The
 * provided `animation` value is expected to be an array consisting of {\@link state state} and
 * {\@link transition transition} declarations.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'my-component',
 *   templateUrl: 'my-component-tpl.html',
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger("myAnimationTrigger", [
 *       state(...),
 *       state(...),
 *       transition(...),
 *       transition(...)
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class MyComponent {
 *   myStatusExp = "something";
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger` animation
 * trigger by binding to an element within its template code.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->
 * <div [\@myAnimationTrigger]="myStatusExp">...</div>
 * ```
 *
 * ## Disable Animations
 * A special animation control binding called `\@.disabled` can be placed on an element which will
 * then disable animations for any inner animation triggers situated within the element as well as
 * any animations on the element itself.
 *
 * When true, the `\@.disabled` binding will prevent all animations from rendering. The example
 * below shows how to use this feature:
 *
 * ```ts
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'my-component',
 *   template: `
 *     <div [\@.disabled]="isDisabled">
 *       <div [\@childAnimation]="exp"></div>
 *     </div>
 *   `,
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger("childAnimation", [
 *       // ...
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class MyComponent {
 *   isDisabled = true;
 *   exp = '...';
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The `\@childAnimation` trigger will not animate because `\@.disabled` prevents it from happening
 * (when true).
 *
 * Note that `\@.disabled` will only disable all animations (this means any animations running on
 * the same element will also be disabled).
 *
 * ### Disabling Animations Application-wide
 * When an area of the template is set to have animations disabled, **all** inner components will
 * also have their animations disabled as well. This means that all animations for an angular
 * application can be disabled by placing a host binding set on `\@.disabled` on the topmost Angular
 * component.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import {Component, HostBinding} from '\@angular/core';
 *
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'app-component',
 *   templateUrl: 'app.component.html',
 * })
 * class AppComponent {
 *   \@HostBinding('\@.disabled')
 *   public animationsDisabled = true;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### What about animations that us `query()` and `animateChild()`?
 * Despite inner animations being disabled, a parent animation can {\@link query query} for inner
 * elements located in disabled areas of the template and still animate them as it sees fit. This is
 * also the case for when a sub animation is queried by a parent and then later animated using {\@link
 * animateChild animateChild}.
 *
 * \@experimental Animation support is experimental.

/**
 * `animate` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's
 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\@link
 * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of
 * how animations in Angular are used.
 *
 * `animate` specifies an animation step that will apply the provided `styles` data for a given
 * amount of time based on the provided `timing` expression value. Calls to `animate` are expected
 * to be used within {\@link sequence an animation sequence}, {\@link group group}, or {\@link
 * transition transition}.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `animate` function accepts two input parameters: `timing` and `styles`:
 *
 * - `timing` is a string based value that can be a combination of a duration with optional delay
 * and easing values. The format for the expression breaks down to `duration delay easing`
 * (therefore a value such as `1s 100ms ease-out` will be parse itself into `duration=1000,
 * delay=100, easing=ease-out`. If a numeric value is provided then that will be used as the
 * `duration` value in millisecond form.
 * - `styles` is the style input data which can either be a call to {\@link style style} or {\@link
 * keyframes keyframes}. If left empty then the styles from the destination state will be collected
 * and used (this is useful when describing an animation step that will complete an animation by
 * {\@link transition#the-final-animate-call animating to the final state}).
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // various functions for specifying timing data
 * animate(500, style(...))
 * animate("1s", style(...))
 * animate("100ms 0.5s", style(...))
 * animate("5s ease", style(...))
 * animate("5s 10ms cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.88,.1)", style(...))
 *
 * // either style() of keyframes() can be used
 * animate(500, style({ background: "red" }))
 * animate(500, keyframes([
 *   style({ background: "blue" })),
 *   style({ background: "red" }))
 * ])
 * ```

 *
 * `group` specifies a list of animation steps that are all run in parallel. Grouped animations are
 * useful when a series of styles must be animated/closed off at different starting/ending times.
 *
 * The `group` function can either be used within a {\@link sequence sequence} or a {\@link transition
 * transition} and it will only continue to the next instruction once all of the inner animation
 * steps have completed.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `steps` data that is passed into the `group` animation function can either consist of {\@link
 * style style} or {\@link animate animate} function calls. Each call to `style()` or `animate()`
 * within a group will be executed instantly (use {\@link keyframes keyframes} or a {\@link
 * animate#usage animate() with a delay value} to offset styles to be applied at a later time).
 *
 * ```typescript

 *
 * `sequence` Specifies a list of animation steps that are run one by one. (`sequence` is used by

 *
 * The `sequence` function can either be used within a {\@link group group} or a {\@link transition

 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `steps` data that is passed into the `sequence` animation function can either consist of

 *
 * `style` declares a key/value object containing CSS properties/styles that can then be used for
 * {\@link state animation states}, within an {\@link sequence animation sequence}, or as styling data
 * for both {\@link animate animate} and {\@link keyframes keyframes}.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * `style` takes in a key/value string map as data and expects one or more CSS property/value pairs
 * to be defined.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // string values are used for css properties
 * style({ background: "red", color: "blue" })
 *
 * // numerical (pixel) values are also supported

 * ```
 *
 * #### Auto-styles (using `*`)
 *
 * When an asterix (`*`) character is used as a value then it will be detected from the element
 * being animated and applied as animation data when the animation starts.
 *
 * This feature proves useful for a state depending on layout and/or environment factors; in such
 * cases the styles are calculated just before the animation starts.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // the steps below will animate from 0 to the
 * // actual height of the element
 * style({ height: 0 }),
 * animate("1s", style({ height: "*" }))
 * ```
 *

 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\@link
 * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of
 * how animations in Angular are used.
 *
 * `state` declares an animation state within the given trigger. When a state is active within a
 * component then its associated styles will persist on the element that the trigger is attached to
 * (even when the animation ends).
 *
 * To animate between states, have a look at the animation {\@link transition transition} DSL
 * function. To register states to an animation trigger please have a look at the {\@link trigger
 * trigger} function.
 *
 * #### The `void` state
 *
 * The `void` state value is a reserved word that angular uses to determine when the element is not
 * apart of the application anymore (e.g. when an `ngIf` evaluates to false then the state of the
 * associated element is void).
 *
 * #### The `*` (default) state
 *
 * The `*` state (when styled) is a fallback state that will be used if the state that is being
 * animated is not declared within the trigger.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * `state` will declare an animation state with its associated styles
 * within the given trigger.
 *
 * - `stateNameExpr` can be one or more state names separated by commas.
 * - `styles` refers to the {\@link style styling data} that will be persisted on the element once

 *
 * // user-defined states
 * state("closed", style({ height: 0 }))

 * how animations in Angular are used.
 *
 * `keyframes` specifies a collection of {\@link style style} entries each optionally characterized
 * by an `offset` value.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `keyframes` animation function is designed to be used alongside the {\@link animate animate}
 * animation function. Instead of applying animations from where they are currently to their
 * destination, keyframes can describe how each style entry is applied and at what point within the
 * animation arc (much like CSS Keyframe Animations do).
 *
 * For each `style()` entry an `offset` value can be set. Doing so allows to specifiy at what
 * percentage of the animate time the styles will be applied.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // the provided offset values describe when each backgroundColor value is applied.
 * animate("5s", keyframes([
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "red", offset: 0 }),
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "blue", offset: 0.2 }),
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "orange", offset: 0.3 }),
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "black", offset: 1 })
 * ]))
 * ```
 *
 * Alternatively, if there are no `offset` values used within the style entries then the offsets
 * will be calculated automatically.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * animate("5s", keyframes([
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "red" }) // offset = 0
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "blue" }) // offset = 0.33
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "orange" }) // offset = 0.66
 *   style({ backgroundColor: "black" }) // offset = 1
 * ]))
 * ```
 *
 * {\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}

/**
 * `transition` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's
 * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\@link
 * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of
 * how animations in Angular are used.
 *
 * `transition` declares the {\@link sequence sequence of animation steps} that will be run when the
 * provided `stateChangeExpr` value is satisfied. The `stateChangeExpr` consists of a `state1 =>
 * state2` which consists of two known states (use an asterix (`*`) to refer to a dynamic starting
 * and/or ending state).
 *
 * A function can also be provided as the `stateChangeExpr` argument for a transition and this
 * function will be executed each time a state change occurs. If the value returned within the
 * function is true then the associated animation will be run.
 *
 * Animation transitions are placed within an {\@link trigger animation trigger}. For an transition
 * to animate to a state value and persist its styles then one or more {\@link state animation
 * states} is expected to be defined.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * An animation transition is kicked off the `stateChangeExpr` predicate evaluates to true based on
 * what the previous state is and what the current state has become. In other words, if a transition
 * is defined that matches the old/current state criteria then the associated animation will be
 * triggered.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // all transition/state changes are defined within an animation trigger
 * trigger("myAnimationTrigger", [
 *   // if a state is defined then its styles will be persisted when the
 *   // animation has fully completed itself
 *   state("on", style({ background: "green" })),
 *   state("off", style({ background: "grey" })),
 *
 *   // a transition animation that will be kicked off when the state value
 *   // bound to "myAnimationTrigger" changes from "on" to "off"
 *   transition("on => off", animate(500)),
 *
 *   // it is also possible to do run the same animation for both directions
 *   transition("on <=> off", animate(500)),
 *
 *   // or to define multiple states pairs separated by commas
 *   transition("on => off, off => void", animate(500)),
 *
 *   // this is a catch-all state change for when an element is inserted into
 *   // the page and the destination state is unknown
 *   transition("void => *", [
 *     style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *     animate(500)
 *   ]),
 *
 *   // this will capture a state change between any states
 *   transition("* => *", animate("1s 0s")),
 *
 *   // you can also go full out and include a function
 *   transition((fromState, toState) => {
 *     // when `true` then it will allow the animation below to be invoked
 *     return fromState == "off" && toState == "on";
 *   }, animate("1s 0s"))
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger` animation
 * trigger by binding to an element within its template code.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->
 * <div [\@myAnimationTrigger]="myStatusExp">...</div>
 * ```
 *
 * #### The final `animate` call
 *
 * If the final step within the transition steps is a call to `animate()` that **only** uses a
 * timing value with **no style data** then it will be automatically used as the final animation arc
 * for the element to animate itself to the final state. This involves an automatic mix of
 * adding/removing CSS styles so that the element will be in the exact state it should be for the
 * applied state to be presented correctly.
 *
 * ```
 * // start off by hiding the element, but make sure that it animates properly to whatever state
 * // is currently active for "myAnimationTrigger"
 * transition("void => *", [
 *   style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *   animate(500)
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * ### Using :enter and :leave
 *
 * Given that enter (insertion) and leave (removal) animations are so common, the `transition`
 * function accepts both `:enter` and `:leave` values which are aliases for the `void => *` and `*
 * => void` state changes.
 *
 * ```
 * transition(":enter", [
 *   style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))
 * ]),
 * transition(":leave", [
 *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * ### Boolean values
 * if a trigger binding value is a boolean value then it can be matched using a transition
 * expression that compares `true` and `false` or `1` and `0`.
 *
 * ```
 * // in the template
 * <div [\@openClose]="open ? true : false">...</div>
 *
 * // in the component metadata
 * trigger('openClose', [
 *   state('true', style({ height: '*' })),
 *   state('false', style({ height: '0px' })),
 *   transition('false <=> true', animate(500))
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * ### Using :increment and :decrement
 * In addition to the :enter and :leave transition aliases, the :increment and :decrement aliases
 * can be used to kick off a transition when a numeric value has increased or decreased in value.
 *
 * ```
 * import {group, animate, query, transition, style, trigger} from '\@angular/animations';
 * import {Component} from '\@angular/core';
 *
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'banner-carousel-component',
 *   styles: [`
 *     .banner-container {
 *        position:relative;
 *        height:500px;
 *        overflow:hidden;
 *      }
 *     .banner-container > .banner {
 *        position:absolute;
 *        left:0;
 *        top:0;
 *        font-size:200px;

/**
 * `animateChild` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's
 * animation DSL language. It works by allowing a queried element to execute its own
 * animation within the animation sequence.
 *
 * Each time an animation is triggered in angular, the parent animation
 * will always get priority and any child animations will be blocked. In order
 * for a child animation to run, the parent animation must query each of the elements
 * containing child animations and then allow the animations to run using `animateChild`.
 *
 * The example HTML code below shows both parent and child elements that have animation
 * triggers that will execute at the same time.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- parent-child.component.html -->
 * <button (click)="exp =! exp">Toggle</button>
 * <hr>
 *
 * <div [\@parentAnimation]="exp">
 *   <header>Hello</header>
 *   <div [\@childAnimation]="exp">
 *       one
 *   </div>
 *   <div [\@childAnimation]="exp">
 *       two
 *   </div>
 *   <div [\@childAnimation]="exp">
 *       three
 *   </div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * Now when the `exp` value changes to true, only the `parentAnimation` animation will animate
 * because it has priority. However, using `query` and `animateChild` each of the inner animations
 * can also fire:
 *
 * ```ts
 * // parent-child.component.ts
 * import {trigger, transition, animate, style, query, animateChild} from '\@angular/animations';
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'parent-child-component',
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger('parentAnimation', [
 *       transition('false => true', [
 *         query('header', [
 *           style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *           animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))
 *         ]),
 *         query('\@childAnimation', [
 *           animateChild()
 *         ])
 *       ])
 *     ]),
 *     trigger('childAnimation', [
 *       transition('false => true', [
 *         style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *         animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))
 *       ])
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class ParentChildCmp {
 *   exp: boolean = false;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * In the animation code above, when the `parentAnimation` transition kicks off it first queries to
 * find the header element and fades it in. It then finds each of the sub elements that contain the
 * `\@childAnimation` trigger and then allows for their animations to fire.
 *
 * This example can be further extended by using stagger:
 *
 * ```ts
 * query('\@childAnimation', stagger(100, [
 *   animateChild()
 * ]))
 * ```
 *
 * Now each of the sub animations start off with respect to the `100ms` staggering step.
 *
 * ## The first frame of child animations
 * When sub animations are executed using `animateChild` the animation engine will always apply the
 * first frame of every sub animation immediately at the start of the animation sequence. This way
 * the parent animation does not need to set any initial styling data on the sub elements before the
 * sub animations kick off.
 *
 * In the example above the first frame of the `childAnimation`'s `false => true` transition
 * consists of a style of `opacity: 0`. This is applied immediately when the `parentAnimation`
 * animation transition sequence starts. Only then when the `\@childAnimation` is queried and called
 * with `animateChild` will it then animate to its destination of `opacity: 1`.
 *
 * Note that this feature designed to be used alongside {\@link query query()} and it will only work
 * with animations that are assigned using the Angular animation DSL (this means that CSS keyframes
 * and transitions are not handled by this API).
 *
 * \@experimental Animation support is experimental.

 * being animated within the sequence. The provided animation steps are applied
 * to the queried element (by default, an array is provided, then this will be
 * treated as an animation sequence).
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * query() is designed to collect mutiple elements and works internally by using
 * `element.querySelectorAll`. An additional options object can be provided which
 * can be used to limit the total amount of items to be collected.
 *
 * ```js
 * query('div', [
 *   animate(...),
 *   animate(...)
 * ], { limit: 1 })
 * ```
 *
 * query(), by default, will throw an error when zero items are found. If a query
 * has the `optional` flag set to true then this error will be ignored.
 *
 * ```js
 * query('.some-element-that-may-not-be-there', [
 *   animate(...),
 *   animate(...)
 * ], { optional: true })
 * ```
 *
 * ### Special Selector Values
 *
 * The selector value within a query can collect elements that contain angular-specific
 * characteristics
 * using special pseudo-selectors tokens.
 *
 * These include:
 *
 *  - Querying for newly inserted/removed elements using `query(":enter")`/`query(":leave")`
 *  - Querying all currently animating elements using `query(":animating")`
 *  - Querying elements that contain an animation trigger using `query("\@triggerName")`
 *  - Querying all elements that contain an animation triggers using `query("\@*")`
 *  - Including the current element into the animation sequence using `query(":self")`
 *
 *
 *  Each of these pseudo-selector tokens can be merged together into a combined query selector
 * string:
 *
 *  ```
 *  query(':self, .record:enter, .record:leave, \@subTrigger', [...])
 *  ```
 *
 * ### Demo
 *
 * ```
 * \@Component({
 *   selector: 'inner',
 *   template: `
 *     <div [\@queryAnimation]="exp">
 *       <h1>Title</h1>
 *       <div class="content">
 *         Blah blah blah

 *     </div>

 *        // hide the inner elements
 *        query('h1', style({ opacity: 0 })),
 *        query('.content', style({ opacity: 0 })),
 *
 *        // animate the inner elements in, one by one
 *        query('h1', animate(1000, style({ opacity: 1 })),
 *        query('.content', animate(1000, style({ opacity: 1 })),
 *      ])
 *    ])
 *  ]

/**
 * `stagger` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's
 * animation DSL language. It is designed to be used inside of an animation {\@link query query()}
 * and works by issuing a timing gap between after each queried item is animated.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * In the example below there is a container element that wraps a list of items stamped out
 * by an ngFor. The container element contains an animation trigger that will later be set
 * to query for each of the inner items.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- list.component.html -->
 * <button (click)="toggle()">Show / Hide Items</button>
 * <hr />
 * <div [\@listAnimation]="items.length">
 *   <div *ngFor="let item of items">
 *     {{ item }}
 *   </div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * The component code for this looks as such:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import {trigger, transition, style, animate, query, stagger} from '\@angular/animations';
 * \@Component({
 *   templateUrl: 'list.component.html',
 *   animations: [
 *     trigger('listAnimation', [
 *        //...
 *     ])
 *   ]
 * })
 * class ListComponent {
 *   items = [];
 *
 *   showItems() {
 *     this.items = [0,1,2,3,4];
 *   }
 *
 *   hideItems() {
 *     this.items = [];
 *   }
 *
 *   toggle() {
 *     this.items.length ? this.hideItems() : this.showItems();
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * And now for the animation trigger code:
 *
 * ```ts
 * trigger('listAnimation', [
 *   transition('* => *', [ // each time the binding value changes
 *     query(':leave', [
 *       stagger(100, [
 *         animate('0.5s', style({ opacity: 0 }))
 *       ])
 *     ]),
 *     query(':enter', [
 *       style({ opacity: 0 }),
 *       stagger(100, [
 *         animate('0.5s', style({ opacity: 1 }))
 *       ])
 *     ])
 *   ])
 * ])
 * ```
 *
 * Now each time the items are added/removed then either the opacity
 * fade-in animation will run or each removed item will be faded out.
 * When either of these animations occur then a stagger effect will be
 * applied after each item's animation is started.
 *
 * \@experimental Animation support is experimental.

 * \@howToUse
 *
 * If you have imported the {\@link FormsModule} or the {\@link ReactiveFormsModule}, this
 * value accessor will be active on any radio control that has a form directive. You do
 * **not** need to add a special selector to activate it.
 *
 * ### How to use radio buttons with form directives
 *
 * To use radio buttons in a template-driven form, you'll want to ensure that radio buttons
 * in the same group have the same `name` attribute.  Radio buttons with different `name`
 * attributes do not affect each other.
 *
 * {\@example forms/ts/radioButtons/radio_button_example.ts region='TemplateDriven'}
 *
 * When using radio buttons in a reactive form, radio buttons in the same group should have the
 * same `formControlName`. You can also add a `name` attribute, but it's optional.
 *
 * {\@example forms/ts/reactiveRadioButtons/reactive_radio_button_example.ts region='Reactive'}
 *
 *  * **npm package**: `\@angular/forms`

 * \@whatItDoes Writes values and listens to changes on a select element.
 *
 * Used by {\@link NgModel}, {\@link FormControlDirective}, and {\@link FormControlName}
 * to keep the view synced with the {\@link FormControl} model.
 *
 * \@howToUse
 *
 * If you have imported the {\@link FormsModule} or the {\@link ReactiveFormsModule}, this
 * value accessor will be active on any select control that has a form directive. You do
 * **not** need to add a special selector to activate it.
 *
 * ### How to use select controls with form directives
 *
 * To use a select in a template-driven form, simply add an `ngModel` and a `name`
 * attribute to the main `<select>` tag.
 *
 * If your option values are simple strings, you can bind to the normal `value` property
 * on the option.  If your option values happen to be objects (and you'd like to save the
 * selection in your form as an object), use `ngValue` instead:
 *
 * {\@example forms/ts/selectControl/select_control_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * In reactive forms, you'll also want to add your form directive (`formControlName` or
 * `formControl`) on the main `<select>` tag. Like in the former example, you have the
 * choice of binding to the  `value` or `ngValue` property on the select's options.
 *
 * {\@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * ### Caveat: Option selection
 *
 * Angular uses object identity to select option. It's possible for the identities of items
 * to change while the data does not. This can happen, for example, if the items are produced
 * from an RPC to the server, and that RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the
 * second response will produce objects with different identities.
 *
 * To customize the default option comparison algorithm, `<select>` supports `compareWith` input.
 * `compareWith` takes a **function** which has two arguments: `option1` and `option2`.
 * If `compareWith` is given, Angular selects option by the return value of the function.
 *
 * #### Syntax
 *
 * ```
 * <select [compareWith]="compareFn"  [(ngModel)]="selectedCountries">
 *     <option *ngFor="let country of countries" [ngValue]="country">
 *         {{country.name}}
 *     </option>
 * </select>
 *
 * compareFn(c1: Country, c2: Country): boolean {
 *     return c1 && c2 ? c1.id === c2.id : c1 === c2;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Note: We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired
 * for selects in Firefox and IE:
 * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1024350
 * https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/4660045/

/**
 * \@whatItDoes Tracks the value and validation status of an individual form control.
 *
 * It is one of the three fundamental building blocks of Angular forms, along with
 * {\@link FormGroup} and {\@link FormArray}.
 *
 * \@howToUse
 *
 * When instantiating a {\@link FormControl}, you can pass in an initial value as the
 * first argument. Example:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const ctrl = new FormControl('some value');
 * console.log(ctrl.value);     // 'some value'
 * ```
 *
 * You can also initialize the control with a form state object on instantiation,
 * which includes both the value and whether or not the control is disabled.
 * You can't use the value key without the disabled key; both are required
 * to use this way of initialization.

 * const ctrl = new FormControl({value: 'n/a', disabled: true});
 * console.log(ctrl.value);     // 'n/a'
 * console.log(ctrl.status);   // 'DISABLED'
 * ```
 *
 * The second {\@link FormControl} argument can accept one of three things:
 * * a sync validator function
 * * an array of sync validator functions
 * * an options object containing validator and/or async validator functions
 *
 * Example of a single sync validator function:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const ctrl = new FormControl('', Validators.required);
 * console.log(ctrl.value);     // ''
 * console.log(ctrl.status);   // 'INVALID'
 * ```
 *
 * Example using options object:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const ctrl = new FormControl('', {
 *    validators: Validators.required,
 *    asyncValidators: myAsyncValidator
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * The options object can also be used to define when the control should update.
 * By default, the value and validity of a control updates whenever the value
 * changes. You can configure it to update on the blur event instead by setting
 * the `updateOn` option to `'blur'`.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const c = new FormControl('', { updateOn: 'blur' });
 * ```
 *
 * You can also set `updateOn` to `'submit'`, which will delay value and validity
 * updates until the parent form of the control fires a submit event.
 *
 * See its superclass, {\@link AbstractControl}, for more properties and methods.

/**
 * \@whatItDoes Tracks the value and validity state of a group of {\@link FormControl}
 * instances.
 *
 * A `FormGroup` aggregates the values of each child {\@link FormControl} into one object,
 * with each control name as the key.  It calculates its status by reducing the statuses
 * of its children. For example, if one of the controls in a group is invalid, the entire
 * group becomes invalid.
 *
 * `FormGroup` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,
 * along with {\@link FormControl} and {\@link FormArray}.
 *
 * \@howToUse
 *
 * When instantiating a {\@link FormGroup}, pass in a collection of child controls as the first
 * argument. The key for each child will be the name under which it is registered.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```
 * const form = new FormGroup({
 *   first: new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),
 *   last: new FormControl('Drew'),
 * });
 *
 * console.log(form.value);   // {first: 'Nancy', last; 'Drew'}
 * console.log(form.status);  // 'VALID'
 * ```
 *
 * You can also include group-level validators as the second arg, or group-level async
 * validators as the third arg. These come in handy when you want to perform validation
 * that considers the value of more than one child control.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```
 * const form = new FormGroup({
 *   password: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),
 *   passwordConfirm: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),
 * }, passwordMatchValidator);
 *
 *
 * function passwordMatchValidator(g: FormGroup) {
 *    return g.get('password').value === g.get('passwordConfirm').value
 *       ? null : {'mismatch': true};
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Like {\@link FormControl} instances, you can alternatively choose to pass in
 * validators and async validators as part of an options object.
 *
 * ```
 * const form = new FormGroup({
 *   password: new FormControl('')
 *   passwordConfirm: new FormControl('')
 * }, {validators: passwordMatchValidator, asyncValidators: otherValidator});
 * ```
 *
 * The options object can also be used to set a default value for each child
 * control's `updateOn` property. If you set `updateOn` to `'blur'` at the
 * group level, all child controls will default to 'blur', unless the child
 * has explicitly specified a different `updateOn` value.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const c = new FormGroup({
 *    one: new FormControl()
 * }, {updateOn: 'blur'});
 * ```
 *
 * * **npm package**: `\@angular/forms`

/**
 * \@whatItDoes Tracks the value and validity state of an array of {\@link FormControl},
 * {\@link FormGroup} or {\@link FormArray} instances.
 *
 * A `FormArray` aggregates the values of each child {\@link FormControl} into an array.
 * It calculates its status by reducing the statuses of its children. For example, if one of
 * the controls in a `FormArray` is invalid, the entire array becomes invalid.
 *
 * `FormArray` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,
 * along with {\@link FormControl} and {\@link FormGroup}.
 *
 * \@howToUse
 *
 * When instantiating a {\@link FormArray}, pass in an array of child controls as the first
 * argument.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```
 * const arr = new FormArray([
 *   new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),
 *   new FormControl('Drew'),
 * ]);
 *
 * console.log(arr.value);   // ['Nancy', 'Drew']
 * console.log(arr.status);  // 'VALID'
 * ```
 *
 * You can also include array-level validators and async validators. These come in handy
 * when you want to perform validation that considers the value of more than one child
 * control.
 *
 * The two types of validators can be passed in separately as the second and third arg
 * respectively, or together as part of an options object.
 *
 * ```
 * const arr = new FormArray([
 *   new FormControl('Nancy'),
 *   new FormControl('Drew')
 * ], {validators: myValidator, asyncValidators: myAsyncValidator});
 * ```
 *
 * The options object can also be used to set a default value for each child
 * control's `updateOn` property. If you set `updateOn` to `'blur'` at the
 * array level, all child controls will default to 'blur', unless the child
 * has explicitly specified a different `updateOn` value.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const c = new FormArray([
 *    new FormControl()
 * ], {updateOn: 'blur'});
 * ```
 *
 * ### Adding or removing controls
 *
 * To change the controls in the array, use the `push`, `insert`, or `removeAt` methods
 * in `FormArray` itself. These methods ensure the controls are properly tracked in the
 * form's hierarchy. Do not modify the array of `AbstractControl`s used to instantiate
 * the `FormArray` directly, as that will result in strange and unexpected behavior such
 * as broken change detection.
 *
 * * **npm package**: `\@angular/forms`
 *
 * \@stable

/**
 * \@whatItDoes Creates a top-level {\@link FormGroup} instance and binds it to a form
 * to track aggregate form value and validation status.
 *
 * \@howToUse
 *
 * As soon as you import the `FormsModule`, this directive becomes active by default on
 * all `<form>` tags.  You don't need to add a special selector.
 *
 * You can export the directive into a local template variable using `ngForm` as the key
 * (ex: `#myForm="ngForm"`). This is optional, but useful.  Many properties from the underlying
 * {\@link FormGroup} instance are duplicated on the directive itself, so a reference to it
 * will give you access to the aggregate value and validity status of the form, as well as
 * user interaction properties like `dirty` and `touched`.
 *
 * To register child controls with the form, you'll want to use {\@link NgModel} with a
 * `name` attribute.  You can also use {\@link NgModelGroup} if you'd like to create
 * sub-groups within the form.
 *
 * You can listen to the directive's `ngSubmit` event to be notified when the user has
 * triggered a form submission. The `ngSubmit` event will be emitted with the original form
 * submission event.
 *
 * In template driven forms, all `<form>` tags are automatically tagged as `NgForm`.
 * If you want to import the `FormsModule` but skip its usage in some forms,
 * for example, to use native HTML5 validation, you can add `ngNoForm` and the `<form>`
 * tags won't create an `NgForm` directive. In reactive forms, using `ngNoForm` is
 * unnecessary because the `<form>` tags are inert. In that case, you would
 * refrain from using the `formGroup` directive.
 *
 * {\@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * * **npm package**: `\@angular/forms`
 *
 * * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`

/**
 * \@whatItDoes Creates a {\@link FormControl} instance from a domain model and binds it
 * to a form control element.
 *
 * The {\@link FormControl} instance will track the value, user interaction, and
 * validation status of the control and keep the view synced with the model. If used
 * within a parent form, the directive will also register itself with the form as a child
 * control.
 *
 * \@howToUse
 *
 * This directive can be used by itself or as part of a larger form. All you need is the
 * `ngModel` selector to activate it.
 *
 * It accepts a domain model as an optional {\@link Input}. If you have a one-way binding
 * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component
 * class will set the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax
 * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI will always be synced back to
 * the domain model in your class as well.
 *
 * If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated {\@link FormControl} (like
 * validity state), you can also export the directive into a local template variable using
 * `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar="ngModel"`). You can then access the control using the
 * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)
 * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a
 * full list of properties directly available in {\@link AbstractControlDirective}.
 *
 * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:
 *
 * {\@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute
 * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.
 *
 * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or
 * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you. You can access
 * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:
 * `#f="ngForm"`). Then you can pass it where it needs to go on submit.
 *
 * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for
 * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather
 * than the domain model's value on submit.
 *
 * Take a look at an example of using `ngModel` within a form:
 *
 * {\@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * To see `ngModel` examples with different form control types, see:
 *
 * * Radio buttons: {\@link RadioControlValueAccessor}
 * * Selects: {\@link SelectControlValueAccessor}

/**
 * \@whatItDoes Syncs a standalone {\@link FormControl} instance to a form control element.
 *
 * In other words, this directive ensures that any values written to the {\@link FormControl}
 * instance programmatically will be written to the DOM element (model -> view). Conversely,
 * any values written to the DOM element through user input will be reflected in the
 * {\@link FormControl} instance (view -> model).
 *
 * \@howToUse
 *
 * Use this directive if you'd like to create and manage a {\@link FormControl} instance directly.
 * Simply create a {\@link FormControl}, save it to your component class, and pass it into the
 * {\@link FormControlDirective}.
 *
 * This directive is designed to be used as a standalone control.  Unlike {\@link FormControlName},
 * it does not require that your {\@link FormControl} instance be part of any parent
 * {\@link FormGroup}, and it won't be registered to any {\@link FormGroupDirective} that
 * exists above it.
 *
 * **Get the value**: the `value` property is always synced and available on the
 * {\@link FormControl} instance. See a full list of available properties in
 * {\@link AbstractControl}.
 *
 * **Set the value**: You can pass in an initial value when instantiating the {\@link FormControl},
 * or you can set it programmatically later using {\@link AbstractControl#setValue setValue} or
 * {\@link AbstractControl#patchValue patchValue}.
 *
 * **Listen to value**: If you want to listen to changes in the value of the control, you can
 * subscribe to the {\@link AbstractControl#valueChanges valueChanges} event.  You can also listen to
 * {\@link AbstractControl#statusChanges statusChanges} to be notified when the validation status is
 * re-calculated.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * {\@example forms/ts/simpleFormControl/simple_form_control_example.ts region='Component'}
 *
 * * **npm package**: `\@angular/forms`
 *
 * * **NgModule**: `ReactiveFormsModule`

 *

/**
 * \@whatItDoes Syncs a nested {\@link FormGroup} to a DOM element.
 *
 * \@howToUse
 *
 * This directive can only be used with a parent {\@link FormGroupDirective} (selector:
 * `[formGroup]`).
 *
 * It accepts the string name of the nested {\@link FormGroup} you want to link, and
 * will look for a {\@link FormGroup} registered with that name in the parent
 * {\@link FormGroup} instance you passed into {\@link FormGroupDirective}.
 *
 * Nested form groups can come in handy when you want to validate a sub-group of a
 * form separately from the rest or when you'd like to group the values of certain
 * controls into their own nested object.
 *
 * **Access the group**: You can access the associated {\@link FormGroup} using the
 * {\@link AbstractControl#get get} method. Ex: `this.form.get('name')`.
 *
 * You can also access individual controls within the group using dot syntax.
 * Ex: `this.form.get('name.first')`
 *
 * **Get the value**: the `value` property is always synced and available on the
 * {\@link FormGroup}. See a full list of available properties in {\@link AbstractControl}.
 *
 * **Set the value**: You can set an initial value for each child control when instantiating
 * the {\@link FormGroup}, or you can set it programmatically later using
 * {\@link AbstractControl#setValue setValue} or {\@link AbstractControl#patchValue patchValue}.
 *
 * **Listen to value**: If you want to listen to changes in the value of the group, you can
 * subscribe to the {\@link AbstractControl#valueChanges valueChanges} event.  You can also listen to
 * {\@link AbstractControl#statusChanges statusChanges} to be notified when the validation status is
 * re-calculated.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * {\@example forms/ts/nestedFormGroup/nested_form_group_example.ts region='Component'}

 * Component to display an icon. It can be used in the following ways:
 *
 * - Specify the svgIcon input to load an SVG icon from a URL previously registered with the
 *   addSvgIcon, addSvgIconInNamespace, addSvgIconSet, or addSvgIconSetInNamespace methods of
 *   MatIconRegistry. If the svgIcon value contains a colon it is assumed to be in the format
 *   "[namespace]:[name]", if not the value will be the name of an icon in the default namespace.
 *   Examples:
 *     `<mat-icon svgIcon="left-arrow"></mat-icon>
 *     <mat-icon svgIcon="animals:cat"></mat-icon>`
 *
 * - Use a font ligature as an icon by putting the ligature text in the content of the `<mat-icon>`
 *   component. By default the Material icons font is used as described at
 *   http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web. You can specify an
 *   alternate font by setting the fontSet input to either the CSS class to apply to use the
 *   desired font, or to an alias previously registered with MatIconRegistry.registerFontClassAlias.
 *   Examples:
 *     `<mat-icon>home</mat-icon>
 *     <mat-icon fontSet="myfont">sun</mat-icon>`
 *
 * - Specify a font glyph to be included via CSS rules by setting the fontSet input to specify the
 *   font, and the fontIcon input to specify the icon. Typically the fontIcon will specify a
 *   CSS class which causes the glyph to be displayed via a :before selector, as in
 *   https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/
 *   Example:
 *     `<mat-icon fontSet="fa" fontIcon="alarm"></mat-icon>`

     * // for clicks anywhere on the "document"; when document is clicked it
     * // will log a MouseEvent object to the console. If the result is less

     *
     * <img src="./img/forkJoin.png" width="100%">
     *
     * `forkJoin` is an operator that takes any number of Observables which can be passed either as an array
     * or directly as arguments. If no input Observables are provided, resulting stream will complete
     * immediately.
     *
     * `forkJoin` will wait for all passed Observables to complete and then it will emit an array with last
     * values from corresponding Observables. So if you pass `n` Observables to the operator, resulting
     * array will have `n` values, where first value is the last thing emitted by the first Observable,
     * second value is the last thing emitted by the second Observable and so on. That means `forkJoin` will
     * not emit more than once and it will complete after that. If you need to emit combined values not only
     * at the end of lifecycle of passed Observables, but also throughout it, try out {@link combineLatest}
     * or {@link zip} instead.
     *
     * In order for resulting array to have the same length as the number of input Observables, whenever any of
     * that Observables completes without emitting any value, `forkJoin` will complete at that moment as well
     * and it will not emit anything either, even if it already has some last values from other Observables.
     * Conversely, if there is an Observable that never completes, `forkJoin` will never complete as well,
     * unless at any point some other Observable completes without emitting value, which brings us back to
     * the previous case. Overall, in order for `forkJoin` to emit a value, all Observables passed as arguments
     * have to emit something at least once and complete.
     *
     * If any input Observable errors at some point, `forkJoin` will error as well and all other Observables
     * will be immediately unsubscribed.
     *
     * Optionally `forkJoin` accepts project function, that will be called with values which normally
     * would land in emitted array. Whatever is returned by project function, will appear in output
     * Observable instead. This means that default project can be thought of as a function that takes
     * all its arguments and puts them into an array. Note that project function will be called only
     * when output Observable is supposed to emit a result.
     *
     * @example <caption>Use forkJoin with operator emitting immediately</caption>
     * const observable = Rx.Observable.forkJoin(
     *   Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3, 4),
     *   Rx.Observable.of(5, 6, 7, 8)

     * );
     *
     * // Logs:
     * // [4, 8]
     * // "This is how it ends!"
     *
     *
     * @example <caption>Use forkJoin with operator emitting after some time</caption>
     * const observable = Rx.Observable.forkJoin(
     *   Rx.Observable.interval(1000).take(3), // emit 0, 1, 2 every second and complete
     *   Rx.Observable.interval(500).take(4) // emit 0, 1, 2, 3 every half a second and complete
     * );

     *
     * <span class="informal">Creates an Observable from DOM events, or Node.js
     * EventEmitter events or others.</span>
     *
     * <img src="./img/fromEvent.png" width="100%">
     *
     * `fromEvent` accepts as a first argument event target, which is an object with methods
     * for registering event handler functions. As a second argument it takes string that indicates
     * type of event we want to listen for. `fromEvent` supports selected types of event targets,
     * which are described in detail below. If your event target does not match any of the ones listed,
     * you should use {@link fromEventPattern}, which can be used on arbitrary APIs.
     * When it comes to APIs supported by `fromEvent`, their methods for adding and removing event
     * handler functions have different names, but they all accept a string describing event type
     * and function itself, which will be called whenever said event happens.
     *
     * Every time resulting Observable is subscribed, event handler function will be registered
     * to event target on given event type. When that event fires, value
     * passed as a first argument to registered function will be emitted by output Observable.
     * When Observable is unsubscribed, function will be unregistered from event target.
     *
     * Note that if event target calls registered function with more than one argument, second
     * and following arguments will not appear in resulting stream. In order to get access to them,
     * you can pass to `fromEvent` optional project function, which will be called with all arguments
     * passed to event handler. Output Observable will then emit value returned by project function,
     * instead of the usual value.
     *
     * Remember that event targets listed below are checked via duck typing. It means that
     * no matter what kind of object you have and no matter what environment you work in,
     * you can safely use `fromEvent` on that object if it exposes described methods (provided
     * of course they behave as was described above). So for example if Node.js library exposes
     * event target which has the same method names as DOM EventTarget, `fromEvent` is still
     * a good choice.
     *
     * If the API you use is more callback then event handler oriented (subscribed
     * callback function fires only once and thus there is no need to manually
     * unregister it), you should use {@link bindCallback} or {@link bindNodeCallback}
     * instead.
     *
     * `fromEvent` supports following types of event targets:
     *
     * **DOM EventTarget**
     *
     * This is an object with `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener` methods.
     *
     * In the browser, `addEventListener` accepts - apart from event type string and event
     * handler function arguments - optional third parameter, which is either an object or boolean,
     * both used for additional configuration how and when passed function will be called. When
     * `fromEvent` is used with event target of that type, you can provide this values
     * as third parameter as well.
     *
     * **Node.js EventEmitter**
     *
     * An object with `addListener` and `removeListener` methods.
     *
     * **JQuery-style event target**
     *
     * An object with `on` and `off` methods
     *
     * **DOM NodeList**
     *
     * List of DOM Nodes, returned for example by `document.querySelectorAll` or `Node.childNodes`.
     *
     * Although this collection is not event target in itself, `fromEvent` will iterate over all Nodes
     * it contains and install event handler function in every of them. When returned Observable
     * is unsubscribed, function will be removed from all Nodes.
     *
     * **DOM HtmlCollection**
     *
     * Just as in case of NodeList it is a collection of DOM nodes. Here as well event handler function is
     * installed and removed in each of elements.
     *
     *
     * @example <caption>Emits clicks happening on the DOM document</caption>
     * var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');
     * clicks.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
     *
     * // Results in:
     * // MouseEvent object logged to console every time a click
     * // occurs on the document.
     *
     *
     * @example <caption>Use addEventListener with capture option</caption>
     * var clicksInDocument = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click', true); // note optional configuration parameter
     *                                                                          // which will be passed to addEventListener
     * var clicksInDiv = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(someDivInDocument, 'click');
     *
     * clicksInDocument.subscribe(() => console.log('document'));
     * clicksInDiv.subscribe(() => console.log('div'));

 * Combines multiple Observables to create an Observable whose values are
 * calculated from the latest values of each of its input Observables.
 *
 * <span class="informal">Whenever any input Observable emits a value, it
 * computes a formula using the latest values from all the inputs, then emits
 * the output of that formula.</span>
 *
 * <img src="./img/combineLatest.png" width="100%">
 *
 * `combineLatest` combines the values from all the Observables passed as
 * arguments. This is done by subscribing to each Observable in order and,
 * whenever any Observable emits, collecting an array of the most recent
 * values from each Observable. So if you pass `n` Observables to operator,
 * returned Observable will always emit an array of `n` values, in order
 * corresponding to order of passed Observables (value from the first Observable
 * on the first place and so on).
 *
 * Static version of `combineLatest` accepts either an array of Observables
 * or each Observable can be put directly as an argument. Note that array of
 * Observables is good choice, if you don't know beforehand how many Observables
 * you will combine. Passing empty array will result in Observable that
 * completes immediately.
 *
 * To ensure output array has always the same length, `combineLatest` will
 * actually wait for all input Observables to emit at least once,
 * before it starts emitting results. This means if some Observable emits
 * values before other Observables started emitting, all that values but last
 * will be lost. On the other hand, is some Observable does not emit value but
 * completes, resulting Observable will complete at the same moment without
 * emitting anything, since it will be now impossible to include value from
 * completed Observable in resulting array. Also, if some input Observable does
 * not emit any value and never completes, `combineLatest` will also never emit
 * and never complete, since, again, it will wait for all streams to emit some
 * value.
 *
 * If at least one Observable was passed to `combineLatest` and all passed Observables
 * emitted something, resulting Observable will complete when all combined
 * streams complete. So even if some Observable completes, result of
 * `combineLatest` will still emit values when other Observables do. In case
 * of completed Observable, its value from now on will always be the last
 * emitted value. On the other hand, if any Observable errors, `combineLatest`
 * will error immediately as well, and all other Observables will be unsubscribed.
 *
 * `combineLatest` accepts as optional parameter `project` function, which takes
 * as arguments all values that would normally be emitted by resulting Observable.
 * `project` can return any kind of value, which will be then emitted by Observable
 * instead of default array. Note that `project` does not take as argument that array
 * of values, but values themselves. That means default `project` can be imagined
 * as function that takes all its arguments and puts them into an array.
 *
 *
 * @example <caption>Combine two timer Observables</caption>
 * const firstTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(0, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting from now
 * const secondTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(500, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting 0,5s from now
 * const combinedTimers = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(firstTimer, secondTimer);
 * combinedTimers.subscribe(value => console.log(value));
 * // Logs
 * // [0, 0] after 0.5s
 * // [1, 0] after 1s
 * // [1, 1] after 1.5s
 * // [2, 1] after 2s
 *
 *
 * @example <caption>Combine an array of Observables</caption>
 * const observables = [1, 5, 10].map(
 *   n => Rx.Observable.of(n).delay(n * 1000).startWith(0) // emit 0 and then emit n after n seconds
 * );
 * const combined = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(observables);
 * combined.subscribe(value => console.log(value));
 * // Logs
 * // [0, 0, 0] immediately
 * // [1, 0, 0] after 1s
 * // [1, 5, 0] after 5s
 * // [1, 5, 10] after 10s
 *
 *
 * @example <caption>Use project function to dynamically calculate the Body-Mass Index</caption>

/**
 * Creates an output Observable which sequentially emits all values from given
 * Observable and then moves on to the next.
 *
 * <span class="informal">Concatenates multiple Observables together by
 * sequentially emitting their values, one Observable after the other.</span>
 *
 * <img src="./img/concat.png" width="100%">
 *
 * `concat` joins multiple Observables together, by subscribing to them one at a time and
 * merging their results into the output Observable. You can pass either an array of
 * Observables, or put them directly as arguments. Passing an empty array will result
 * in Observable that completes immediately.
 *
 * `concat` will subscribe to first input Observable and emit all its values, without
 * changing or affecting them in any way. When that Observable completes, it will
 * subscribe to then next Observable passed and, again, emit its values. This will be
 * repeated, until the operator runs out of Observables. When last input Observable completes,
 * `concat` will complete as well. At any given moment only one Observable passed to operator
 * emits values. If you would like to emit values from passed Observables concurrently, check out
 * {@link merge} instead, especially with optional `concurrent` parameter. As a matter of fact,
 * `concat` is an equivalent of `merge` operator with `concurrent` parameter set to `1`.
 *
 * Note that if some input Observable never completes, `concat` will also never complete
 * and Observables following the one that did not complete will never be subscribed. On the other
 * hand, if some Observable simply completes immediately after it is subscribed, it will be
 * invisible for `concat`, which will just move on to the next Observable.
 *
 * If any Observable in chain errors, instead of passing control to the next Observable,
 * `concat` will error immediately as well. Observables that would be subscribed after
 * the one that emitted error, never will.
 *
 * If you pass to `concat` the same Observable many times, its stream of values
 * will be "replayed" on every subscription, which means you can repeat given Observable
 * as many times as you like. If passing the same Observable to `concat` 1000 times becomes tedious,
 * you can always use {@link repeat}.
 *
 * @example <caption>Concatenate a timer counting from 0 to 3 with a synchronous sequence from 1 to 10</caption>
 * var timer = Rx.Observable.interval(1000).take(4);
 * var sequence = Rx.Observable.range(1, 10);
 * var result = Rx.Observable.concat(timer, sequence);
 * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
 *
 * // results in:
 * // 0 -1000ms-> 1 -1000ms-> 2 -1000ms-> 3 -immediate-> 1 ... 10
 *
 *
 * @example <caption>Concatenate an array of 3 Observables</caption>
 * var timer1 = Rx.Observable.interval(1000).take(10);
 * var timer2 = Rx.Observable.interval(2000).take(6);
 * var timer3 = Rx.Observable.interval(500).take(10);
 * var result = Rx.Observable.concat([timer1, timer2, timer3]); // note that array is passed
 * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
 *
 * // results in the following:
 * // (Prints to console sequentially)
 * // -1000ms-> 0 -1000ms-> 1 -1000ms-> ... 9
 * // -2000ms-> 0 -2000ms-> 1 -2000ms-> ... 5
 * // -500ms-> 0 -500ms-> 1 -500ms-> ... 9
 *
 *
 * @example <caption>Concatenate the same Observable to repeat it</caption>
 * const timer = Rx.Observable.interval(1000).take(2);
 *
 * Rx.Observable.concat(timer, timer) // concating the same Observable!
 * .subscribe(
 *   value => console.log(value),
 *   err => {},
 *   () => console.log('...and it is done!')
 * );

 *
 * `debounceTime` delays values emitted by the source Observable, but drops
 * previous pending delayed emissions if a new value arrives on the source
 * Observable. This operator keeps track of the most recent value from the
 * source Observable, and emits that only when `dueTime` enough time has passed
 * without any other value appearing on the source Observable. If a new value
 * appears before `dueTime` silence occurs, the previous value will be dropped
 * and will not be emitted on the output Observable.
 *
 * This is a rate-limiting operator, because it is impossible for more than one
 * value to be emitted in any time window of duration `dueTime`, but it is also
 * a delay-like operator since output emissions do not occur at the same time as
 * they did on the source Observable. Optionally takes a {@link IScheduler} for
 * managing timers.
 *
 * @example <caption>Emit the most recent click after a burst of clicks</caption>
 * var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');
 * var result = clicks.debounceTime(1000);
 * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));

 * Async Scheduler
 *
 * <span class="informal">Schedule task as if you used setTimeout(task, duration)</span>
 *
 * `async` scheduler schedules tasks asynchronously, by putting them on the JavaScript
 * event loop queue. It is best used to delay tasks in time or to schedule tasks repeating
 * in intervals.
 *
 * If you just want to "defer" task, that is to perform it right after currently
 * executing synchronous code ends (commonly achieved by `setTimeout(deferredTask, 0)`),
 * better choice will be the {@link asap} scheduler.
 *
 * @example <caption>Use async scheduler to delay task</caption>
 * const task = () => console.log('it works!');
 *
 * Rx.Scheduler.async.schedule(task, 2000);
 *
 * // After 2 seconds logs:
 * // "it works!"
 *
 *
 * @example <caption>Use async scheduler to repeat task in intervals</caption>
 * function task(state) {
 *   console.log(state);
 *   this.schedule(state + 1, 1000); // `this` references currently executing Action,
 *                                   // which we reschedule with new state and delay
 * }
 *
 * Rx.Scheduler.async.schedule(task, 3000, 0);
 *
 * // Logs:
 * // 0 after 3s
 * // 1 after 4s
 * // 2 after 5s
 * // 3 after 6s

 * Queue Scheduler
 *
 * <span class="informal">Put every next task on a queue, instead of executing it immediately</span>
 *
 * `queue` scheduler, when used with delay, behaves the same as {@link async} scheduler.
 *
 * When used without delay, it schedules given task synchronously - executes it right when
 * it is scheduled. However when called recursively, that is when inside the scheduled task,
 * another task is scheduled with queue scheduler, instead of executing immediately as well,
 * that task will be put on a queue and wait for current one to finish.
 *
 * This means that when you execute task with `queue` scheduler, you are sure it will end
 * before any other task scheduled with that scheduler will start.
 *
 * @examples <caption>Schedule recursively first, then do something</caption>
 *
 * Rx.Scheduler.queue.schedule(() => {
 *   Rx.Scheduler.queue.schedule(() => console.log('second')); // will not happen now, but will be put on a queue
 *
 *   console.log('first');
 * });
 *
 * // Logs:
 * // "first"
 * // "second"
 *
 *
 * @example <caption>Reschedule itself recursively</caption>
 *
 * Rx.Scheduler.queue.schedule(function(state) {
 *   if (state !== 0) {
 *     console.log('before', state);
 *     this.schedule(state - 1); // `this` references currently executing Action,
 *                               // which we reschedule with new state
 *     console.log('after', state);
 *   }

 * // "before", 3
 * // "before", 2
 * // "before", 1
 * // "after", 1
 * // "after", 2
